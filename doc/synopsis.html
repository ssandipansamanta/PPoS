Determination of posterior probability for go-no go decision and predictive power are becoming increasingly common for resource optimization in clinical investigation. Despite the availability of vast published literature on these topics, calculation of posterior probabilities remains challenging for various reasons: first, the terminologies are not consistently used across the literature, and second, the lack of consolidated presentation of various concepts of probability of success. We attempted to fill this gap. In this paper, we have first shown the derivation of these probability of success measures under frequentist and Bayesian paradigm under a general setting. Subsequently, we have presented analytical formula for these probability of success measures for continuous, binary and time-to-event endpoints separately.

This paper can be used as single point reference to determine following measures:
	<ol>
		<li> conditional power </li>
		<li> predictive power based on interim results only </li>
		<li> predictive power using prior information only and </li>
		<li> predictive power using both prior information and interim results. </li>
	</ol>

We have discussed both clinical success and trial success. The discussion in this paper is largely based on normal approximation for prior distribution and the estimate of parameter of interest. In addition, predictive power using beta prior for binomial case is also discussed. Some examples are presented for illustration and associated R code is available in LongCART package.
